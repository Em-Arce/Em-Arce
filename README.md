### Hi there 👋 I am Em.

🧑‍💻 I aim to be a Software Engineer in the next six months.

📝 I’m currently learning Web Development at Avion School.

🗄️  I will submit the outputs from my class in this space.

😃 I’m looking for help in Javascript, Ruby on Rails and best practices in web development.

⚡ Fun fact: I can wake myself up from an impending nightmare 😉.
